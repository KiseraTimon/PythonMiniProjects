#3. Rock, Paper Scissors Game

#Logic
"""
Both the user and the system pick either rock(r) paper(p) or scissors(s)
If one is s and the other is r, r wins because rock crushes scissors
If one is s and the other is p, s wins because scissors cut paper
If one is r and the other is p, p wins because p folds rock
"""

#Map
"""
game logic function:
    The system picks r/p/s
    The user picks r/p/s
    The system runs the logic
    Output the result

Check if the user wants to play again through a function
    If yes, repeat, if no, terminate
